 * above it, the ± nudge buttons stacked on the right (＋ above −), and the
 * setpoint chips stacked on the left (Cool above Heat) — one chip in Heat/Cool,
 * both in Heat / Cool (Auto), where a chip picks which setpoint the scrubber
 * edits. Tinted per the active setpoint — blue for Cool, warm amber for Heat
 * (visual-spec.md).
 *
 * Unlike the purely presentational <ecosee-home-screen> (which only renders the
 * card-owned `.view`), this is an interactive editor, so it owns the transient
 * edit state locally: it seeds `_edit` once from `model`, advances it through the
 * pure reducers in `temperature-adjust.ts`, and emits the shared `ecosee-service-call`
 * with the `climate.set_temperature` call so the host card writes the setpoint.
 * Each ± nudge commits immediately; a drag tracks the finger live but commits
 * once on release. There is no separate Apply step (and no hold-duration prompt,
 * ADR-0003). A value-neutral *tap* on the selected value (a press/release that
 * never moved it) dismisses the overlay without writing — matching the device —
 * while a scrub or a ± nudge, which change the value, keep it open (#93).
