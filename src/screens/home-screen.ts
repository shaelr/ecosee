       Home Screen was clustering everything in the upper-middle and leaving the
       whole lower portion of the card empty whenever no foot row was configured).
       .cluster (flex: 1) is what actually centers the humidity/number/setpoints —
       within whatever space remains once .foot claims its own room, or the full
       body height when there's no foot — so it fills the space actually available
       rather than a size hard-coded to leave room for a foot row whether or not
       one exists. This supersedes issue #55's padding-bottom upward bias with a
       structural one instead: the cluster now centers in its own real remaining
       space, and a configured foot row still reads as sitting above true center
       simply because it shares .body's box with .cluster above it.

       Both gaps were briefly trimmed tighter than this to fit the tallest
       possible stack when the opt-in Resume Schedule pill was a THIRD row
       living beneath the setpoint ovals — .cluster couldn't shrink below its
       own content's height (fixed font sizes, not flexible), so with three
       rows (ovals, resume pill, foot) the tight case needed every bit of gap
       reclaimed to avoid overflowing the fixed-height .screen. ADR-0016
       replaced that separate pill with a combined range pill that swaps
       places WITH the ovals instead of adding a row beneath them, so the
       tallest stack is back down to two rows (setpoint display, foot) and
       both gaps can stay at the same comfortable 3cqw every other screen's
       header/section spacing uses — reverified via Playwright (range pill +
       both foot gauges at once, the current tallest combination) before

  /** The optional UV-index gauge. Rendered only when the seam supplies a model —
   *  absent/unavailable data leaves `uvIndex` null, so the gauge isn't shown
   *  (ADR-0001). The arc is a radius-38 semicircle (path length π·38 ≈ 119.4); its
   *  `stroke-dashoffset` fills it from the green end to the reading's fraction of the
   *  scale. Shows just the arc, index, and muted "UVI" label (issue #91): the band
   *  color already carries the severity, so the visible category word is dropped — the
   *  `sr-only` label still announces the band ("UV index: High") so the reading stays
   *  accessible, mirroring the air-quality element (issue #66). */
