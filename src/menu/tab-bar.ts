/**
 * The persistent bottom tab bar shown across the Main Menu's section screens
 * (System, Sensors, Fan, Schedule), mirroring the device's bottom navigation. It
 * replaces the drill-down Main Menu list: opening the menu lands directly on a
 * section and the bar switches between the sibling sections, with a temperature
 * badge on the left that returns to the thermostat (the Home Screen).
 *
 * Weather is reached from the Home Screen's own affordance, not the bar — as on
 * the device, whose bottom bar carries the thermostat, sensors, fan, voice, and
 * settings, but not weather. The voice/mic tab has no Home Assistant meaning and
 * is dropped; settings maps to the System section (the gear glyph, kept rightmost
 * as on the device). Schedule (ADR-0014) and Comfort Setpoints (ADR-0015) are
 * Card additions — the physical device has no equivalent bottom-bar tab for
 * either, but each is a Main Menu section the same way Sensors and Fan are, so
 * both follow the same reachable-when-configured rule.
 *
 * This module is the pure seam: it takes the active screen, the badge temperature,
 * and which sections are reachable, and returns the ordered, marked-up tab model.
 * The `<ecosee-overlay>` shell renders it; the card supplies the availability from
 * its single overlay-descriptor table so the predicates aren't duplicated here.
